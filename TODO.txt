explain:
- hosting
    - not going to teach HTML
    - you have an html page
    - you can see it on your own computer, file:///
    - want to put it on the internet
    - web server
    - types of hosting
        - you can host on your own computer
            - it has to be always on
            - you need a public IP / port forward
        so... use a server that is always on
        - *your* files on *someone else's* computer
        - file-based / static i.e. github pages
            - html/css, no PHP, node.js, python, etc...
        - hosted solutions
            - e.g. wordpress
                - you get admin access to the website, don't have to worry about php
        - cpanel, etc.
            - you don't get SSH access but you can point and click to upload (FTP) and create databases
        - VPS
            - plain old linux box
            - run any software including PHP, databases, etc..
            - not that hard
- domains
    - ip
    - dns
    - registrar

host on github pages
- do github pages before domain because of DNS propogation time

register domain
- only .me is free
- https://nc.me
- go to email
- login or register
- confirm order
- don't setup github account
- namecheap.com
- domain -> DNS settings
- automatically set to github's IP
- new github repo
- gh-pages branch
- make it the default
